    <p><strong>Welcome to the Class of 1975 Page</strong></p>

    <p>Navotas Elementary School – Central, nestled along Los Martires Street in Navotas City, Philippines, has long been a pillar of primary education for generations of Navoteños. As part of the country’s public school system under the Department of Education, it has remained steadfast in its mission: to nurture young minds and instill in them the values of discipline, community, and learning. Behind its humble yet enduring campus walls, thousands of students have passed—each carrying with them memories that would last a lifetime.</p>

    <p>Navotas City, known across the archipelago as the “Fishing Capital of the Philippines,” lies north of Manila along the shores of Manila Bay. Its lifeblood is the sea. Fishing boats line its coasts, and families build their livelihoods around the tides. Life here has always been rooted in resilience and simplicity—where neighborhoods are tightly knit, and community spirit runs deep.</p>

    <p>In 1975, as our batch came of age, the Philippines was in the thick of Martial Law. Declared just three years prior, the nation was undergoing sweeping political, social, and economic shifts. “Bagong Lipunan” became the national slogan. “Barangay” replaced “barrio.” Public discipline campaigns were everywhere—“Sa ikauunlad ng bayan, disiplina ang kailangan”—and mass media was tightly controlled. But despite the tension in the air, ordinary Filipino life found ways to flourish.</p>

    <p>.....   work-in-progress ...... </p>

    <p>This page is a tribute to those memories. Here, you'll find a roll call of classmates and teachers, photo galleries that take us back, and a celebration of the spirit of a generation shaped by a unique time in Philippine history.</p>
